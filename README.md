# Using arrays and classes to make a game engine.

## How to run

```
npm run dev
```

## Overview

I started this project as I'm Interested In game development however my main motivation behind It Is to explore the power and versatility of arrays and understand them at a more advanced level.

Initially I struggled to wrap my head around making arrays within arrays and looping through them to create cells that acted as 'tiles' for my map however with enough practice I began getting the hang of It. 

My goals are to create a working menu where I can click on a 'tile space' and a selection of tiles and objects will pop up that I can click on to add them to the cell, ultimately creating a customisable map.
